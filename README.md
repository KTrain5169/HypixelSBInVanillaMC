# Plugin Wiki pages
Pages in the `.wiki` folder are automatically synced to the Wiki, thanks to the workflow file.
Changes to these files are auto-pushed to Wiki and vice versa.

If there are differences between the wiki page and the files in `.wiki`, contact a repo maintainer/collaborator and ask them to manually sync.

Wiki sync workflow uses New Relic's [Bi-directional Wiki Sync Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/bi-directional-wiki-sync-action).
